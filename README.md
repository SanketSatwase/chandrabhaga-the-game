## ðŸŽ® How to Play

The goal is to keep Chandrabhaga's stats in a healthy range for as long as possible.

1.  **Monitor the Stats:** Keep an eye on the three status bars:
    *   **Happiness:** Keep this bar as full as possible by petting and playing with Chandrabhaga. If it drops to 0, it's game over!
    *   **Fullness:** This bar represents how full Chandrabhaga is (it's the inverse of hunger). Keep it high by feeding her. If her hunger reaches 100% (meaning Fullness is 0), it's game over.
    *   **Energy:** This decreases over time and with play. Let her nap to restore it. Low energy will make her sleepy.

2.  **Use the Action Buttons:**
    *   Click **Feed** to give her a meal.
    *   Click **Pet** to give her loving scratches.
    *   Click **Play** to have some fun together.
    *   Click **Nap** to let her rest and recharge.

3.  **Read the Messages:** Pay attention to the messages below the cat illustration. they provide clues about her current state and needs.
